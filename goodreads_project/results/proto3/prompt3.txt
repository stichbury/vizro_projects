Create a dashboard with 3 pages. 

The first page has the title "Recent reading" 

The chart is an AG Grid. Only show the columns for Book Title, Author, My Rating, Average Rating, Number of Pages, Original Year Publication Year, Date Read and Categories

The second page has the title "Pages and Book totals" and it shows 1 chart.

The chart shows the cumulative total number of pages read by summing the Number of Pages of each book read in each year, using the Date Read data.
Plot date on the x axis and the number of pages on the y axis using a scale on the left hand side of the chart.

Add a filter so the user can change the x axis to adjust the range of dates by year on the x axis.

Superimpose a bar chart showing the total books read for each year, taking data from the Date Read column. 
Show the total books read using the right hand side of the chart which can be a different scale to the y axis shown on the left hand side.

The third page has the title "Types of book" and it has 2 charts which are side by side in a horizontal layout.

The first chart emphasizes the gap between My Rating and the Average Rating for each row of the dataset.
For each row of the dataset, the My Rating and Average Rating data points are depicted by circles, and connected by a line to show the gap between the two points. 
Stack the books vertically on the y axis and use the x axis to show the rating between 0 and 5. Label each with the Title and Author.

The second chart is a scatter chart. Only use the rows for which My Rating is greater than 0. Plot the date a book was read on the x axis with a label that includes its Title and Author. The y axis is My Rating.
